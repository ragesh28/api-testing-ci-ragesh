## 📁 Project Structure

## 🤖 Keploy Integration (Planned)

This project includes CI/CD setup for Keploy’s API test automation.

However, due to time constraints and tool issues:
- Keploy CLI could not be installed
- VS Code extension didn’t record tests as expected

But the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file is ready with Keploy setup, and we plan to complete test-suite integration soon.
